K means
1.omit nas, scale data
2.apply k means function(need to mention k optimal clusters
                         no need to do dist fun or mention dist method as it is euclidean by default,
                         no need to mention type of clustering method)
3.Apply (result)$cluster to see cluster group, its a vector
4.Join the cluster grp to the data and compare with Hclust using table
5.compare means of raw data and norm data by clusterwise also


Hclust
1.omit nas, scale data
2.apply k means function(need to use dist method and it is euclidean method by default,
                         no need to mention type of clustering method)->gives dendogram o/p
3.cut the dendogram using cutree with number of optimal clusters to get cluster grp result
3.Apply (result)$cluster to see cluster group, its a vector
4.Join the cluster grp to the data and compare with Hclust using table
5.compare means of raw data and norm data by clusterwise
