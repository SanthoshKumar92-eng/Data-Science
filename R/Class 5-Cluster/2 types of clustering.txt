                                    -Hierarchical and K means has diff function to find optimal cluster




-two types of clustering

1. partitional -k means - https://uc-r.github.io/kmeans_clustering
2. heirarchical-(2 types-AGNES and DIANA , AGNES uses 4 methods complete linkage, average,single,
                and ward, DIANA uses no method, most popular is AGNES hc with ward mehod)- https://uc-r.github.io/hc_clustering
